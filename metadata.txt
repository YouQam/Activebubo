name=Active Bubo
qgisMinimumVersion=3.0
description=ActiveBubo is a python coding project developed as the final assignment for the Python in GIS course. The data provided for the project contained a large dataset of GPS tracks, surveilling the movement of more than 20 Eagle Owls over a time span of several years. Browsing through the available data, it was decided by the group to investigate and answer the following research questions: Which is the month and the season in which the owls are most/least active? Does the temporal scope of owl activity change for different regions? For different owl genders? Which owl is the most active?
